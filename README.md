Problem Statement:

A medical facility  has just hired an intern in Machine Learning space due to the vast advancements of ML in the medical field. This facility has given the intern the data of 769 patients which have cancer and who have donâ€™t have cancer. These patients have other conditions as well like past pregnancies, diabetes, insulin intake etc. The doctors are hoping these attributes will help the intern learn & build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is likely to have cancer or not based on certain attributes.
